    <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: For best results, use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. You could swap them for chicken thighs, but the flavor is going to be different.</li>
    <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: Using olive oil is the perfect way to give the chicken a yummy exterior that’s hard to beat. You could swap the olive oil for any other oil of your choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: The perfectly seasoned chicken comes from a combination of chili powder, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
